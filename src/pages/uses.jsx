              I was using a Dell Vostro series notebook which is Intel-based
              prior to this and the difference is night and day. I’ve never
              heard the fans turn on a single time, even under the incredibly
              heavy loads I put it through with my various VMs and build
              processes.

            <Tool title="Apple Magic Mouse 2">
              Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with
              special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special
              powers. But I also like how the tradition mouse works, so Apple's
              Magic Mouse seems like a best fit for my case.

              JetBrains Fleet is a fantastic editor. Though in preview stage,
              it shows much potential to be a good rival to Visual Studio Code.

              I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that
