      I spend my days building things that make work easier for others. But
      sometimes the most exciting ideas don't fit in a 9-to-5 box – that's what
      this little corner of the internet is for! A place for my playground of
      side works, random thoughts, and happy accidents that come from tinkering
      with code.

      Beyond coding, you'll find me enjoying a good cup of coffee ☕️ or tea 🧋,
      and exploring new destinations 🚐
