Even before setting my career path as a Software Developer, I'd made many blogging websites before this. At the time, it all started because I was curious and wanted to share my ideas. But after graduating and starting working, I began writing less and less. I was always telling myself that I would start writing blog posts soon, but the truth is, as you can see, this is the first time I've written a single blog post in a whole year. The reason behind it might be very relatable to all of us, as I thought I was not an expert or anything, not a famous person, and not good at writing, but a regular software engineer. Therefore, why should I take my time writing a post and nobody even read it? 

But now, I have found many reasons to write blog posts as a programmer. Let's see what those reasons are:

## Learn how to communicate and show your ideas
But believe it or not, your software career heavily relies on your ability to communicate and give your ideas. Even if you are a good programmer, your software career won't shine and will be limited without good communication and explanation ability. Also, many programmers claim that writing articles help them also write better code and, importantly, documentation.

## Learn and improve your technical skills
I memorize things better when I try to explain them to somebody. I know this from all of my courses' study groups from university. My lecturer would prefer the groups to deliver the sections instead of them doing it. I still remember everything I tried to explain and show to other group members. Explaining pushes you to learn more about the topic, which is good not only for your readers but for yourself as well. Starting a programming blog is very similar to teaching because, in your blog, you will be teaching the world about programming and computer science.

## Market yourself and kick-start your career
Your blog will open the doors for various networking and business opportunities that you might not find otherwise. Through the blog, you can get a lot of connections and leads for an upcoming freelance and contractor career. See your blog as your always-updated portfolio.

## Document your progress
How many times a week do you find the perfect StackOverflow article that solves your problem and saves you hours of banging your head against a wall? How often do you spend hours solving a problem, but no one else ever benefits from your solution?
Even if you write a post from time to time, weekly, you can show what kind of challenges you faced, how you solved them, which methods and techniques you used, and which ones you avoided. After a year, when you look back, you will see helpful documents you provided to others with valuable insights and show how you approach problems.

## Remove your stress
Disconnect from your daily routine of coding life, give yourself some freedom, be with your thoughts and write about something you would like to share, share your own opinion, write it down and publish. It will make you feel relaxed.

Blogging as a software developer is a fantastic way to increase your personality. Writing a blog can boost whatever you do or planning to do, and it opens doors where you would never expect them. It is worth trying and seeing its benefits.
