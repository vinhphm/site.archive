I'm a bit picky when it comes to themes, and to make it worse, sometimes, I can't decide between dark and light modes. Most developers probably prefer dark mode, but sometimes, I find it makes my eyes tired. And then light themes are nice, but there aren't many options out there. The few popular ones are just too bright or too tanned.

Then, came [Rosé Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com)...

<figure class="md:pt-3 lg:pt-6">
  <div class="lg:scale-120 md:scale-110">
    <Image src={rosePineHomepage} alt="Rosé Pine homepage" class="rounded-lg" />
  </div>
  <figcaption class="lg:important-mt8 md:important-mt4 text-center">Rosé Pine homepage</figcaption>
</figure>

Just like the theme's homepage said, it's something beautiful indeed. And it's not just a light theme, there are also two dark variants. What is even more amazing is that not only it is for your favorite text editor/IDE, you can use Rosé Pine for a wide range of other types of apps as well, they are all listed on the homepage.

Okay, so you probably already got some idea about how Rosé Pine looks in the light variant based on the image on the homepage about. Here is another sneak peek of one of the dark variants in Visual Studio Code:

<figure class="md:pt-3 lg:pt-6">
  <div class="lg:scale-120 md:scale-110">
    <Image src={rosePineVSCode} alt="Rosé Pine Moon on VS Code" class="rounded-lg" />
  </div>
  <figcaption class="lg:important-mt8 md:important-mt4 text-center">
