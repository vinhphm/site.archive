Let's say you recently changed your blog path from `/articles/*` to `/blog/*`. This will impact your SEO on search engines and the links where you had shared before if you don't have a redirect rule for this situation. You could get all the paths for your posts and set a rule for each of them, but that wouldn't be necessary. Instead, you could set a rule to apply to all.

## Netlify

On Netlify, you could either use `netlify.toml` file or `_redirects` file set the redirect rule.

For `netlify.toml`, the rule should look like this:

```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/articles/*"
to = "/blog/:splat"
status = 301
```

And here is how it looks in `_redirects`:

```txt
/articles/*  /blog/:splat  301
```

## Vercel

For Vercel, we're gonna use `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "/articles/(.*)", "destination": "/blog/$1", "statusCode": 301 }
  ]
}
```
