import pagefindSearch from '@/assets/videos/2024/pagefind-search.mp4'
import VideoEmbed from '@/components/VideoEmbed.vue'

The site is having more and more of blog posts now. And sometimes, when I need to find a specific post, it takes time. So a search function is much needed.

<figure class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center md:py-5 lg:py-10">
  <div class="lg:scale-120 md:scale-110">
    <VideoEmbed client:visible src={pagefindSearch} class="rounded shadow-lg" />
  </div>
</figure>
