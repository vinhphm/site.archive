You saw a glitch? Don't worry, that's just the new logo.

## Inspiration

I recently came across [uilabs](https://www.uilabs.dev) by [mrncst](https://twitter.com/mrncst/status/1766117470207647836). And the hero section of the website caught my attention and got me thinking about how I want something similar and rework the style of my logo.

## Breakdown

So the two main changes was obvious:

- The pixellated font style.
- The glitch effect.

These two blends together to create a retro, cyberpunk-ish vibe, which can represent the "unhinged" theme that I'm going for in this website better than the original.

### Pixellated Font Style

After a little digging, I found out that the font used in the hero section is [Redaction](http://www.redaction.us) by Jeremy Mickel / Forest Young. So I downloaded the font and made a "V" out of it.

### Glitch Effect

For the glitch effect, after a while, I found out the site actually use a package named [powerglitch](https://github.com/7PH/powerglitch) by 7PH for the animation. At first I thought it might be a bit overkill, but after checking out the package myself, I saw that was a solid choice because:

- It leverages CSS animations to glitch anything.
- It does not use a canvas, which makes it lightweight and less resource-intensive.
- It does not have any external dependencies.

So, **powerglitch** it is.

Hope you find this kind of style interesting. Maybe you can make one for yourself too.
