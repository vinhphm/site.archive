import pagefindSearch from '@/assets/videos/2024/pagefind-search.mp4'
import VideoEmbed from '@/components/VideoEmbed.vue'

The site is having more and more of blog posts now. And sometimes, when I need to find a specific post, it takes time. So a search function is much needed. After some quick research, I found a library called [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). It is a search engine that can be integrated with any static site generator. In this post, I will walk you through the basic way to integrate it so that you can have something like this:

<figure class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center md:py-5 lg:py-10">
  <div class="lg:scale-120 md:scale-110">
    <VideoEmbed client:idle src={pagefindSearch} class="rounded shadow-lg" />
  </div>
</figure>

## Why Pagefind?

There are a few reasons why I decided to go with Pagefind:

- **Static site compatibility:** Pagefind is designed specifically for static websites, making it an excellent choice for JAMstack and other static site architectures.
- **Lightweight:** The library is very lightweight, adding minimal overhead to your site.
- **Easy setup:** Pagefind can be implemented with minimal configuration, often requiring just a single line of JavaScript.
- **No external dependencies:** It doesn't rely on external services or APIs, which can improve reliability and reduce costs.
- **Automatic index generation:** Pagefind automatically generates a search index from your static site content.
- **Fast performance:** The library offers quick search results, even on large sites. You can check out their [demo on MDN Web Docs](https://mdn.pagefind.app/), very impressive.
- **Multilingual support:** Pagefind can handle content in multiple languages.

## Installation

First, you need to install the library itself and the default stylesheet. You can do it by running the following command:

```shell
npm install --save-dev pagefind @pagefind/default-ui
```

## Configuration

### Indexing

In order for Pagefind to work, it needs to index your site. Let's say you have your build output in the `dist` folder. You can run the following command to index it:

```shell
pagefind --source dist
```

But we want to run automatic after every build. So we need to add a script to our `package.json` file:

```json
{
  //...
  "scripts": {
    //...
    "postbuild": "pagefind --source dist"
  }
  //...
}
```

### Search UI

It depends on the way you want to have the search UI. In the example above, I use the default UI with very little tweaks wrapped in a modal. Inside of the modal, you can place an element with an specific `id` like:

```html
<div id="pagefind__search"></div>
```

Then in the script, you can import the default UI and initialize it :

```js
const { PagefindUI } = await import('@pagefind/default-ui')
const _pagefindUI = new PagefindUI({
  element: '#pagefind__search',
  baseUrl: import.meta.env.BASE_URL,
  bundlePath: `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, '')}/pagefind/`,
  showImages: false,
})
```

You can also customize the styles using the CSS custom properties listed in the [documentation](https://pagefind.app/docs/ui-usage/#customising-the-styles).And if you want to see how I implemented it, check out [<span class="i-ph-file-vue" /> Search.vue](https://github.com/vinhphm/vinh.dev/blob/main/src/components/Search.vue).
