You are new to Cloudflare Workers. You just created your first Worker but not sure what to do next. This is for you.

So a Worker is like a mini-application with a small piece of code that you would like to run. But when? That is when the **Triggers** tab on your Worker's dashboard comes in. There are so many options there but for the sake of this post, we will only talk about **Custom Domains** and **Routes**.

## Triggers

By default, when creating a Worker, you will be assigned to a domain like this `<worker-name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev`. It will show up in the **Routes** list, meaning that any request sent to that domain should trigger your Worker (if you haven't disabled it). I don't know about you but I personally don't like lengthy subdomain routes like that. So I chose one of the options below.

### Use Custom Domains

Using the dashboard interface to add Custom Domains is super quick and easy. It's a one-click operation for websites on Cloudflare or using Cloudflare DNS (which is the requirement here).

> You should note that custom domains point all paths of a domain or subdomain to your Worker, so be wise to choose a domain that won't conflict with your main website. For example, if you have your website at `abc.dev`, you should not add `abc.dev` to your Worker again, instead you can use `<subdomain>.abc.dev`.

### Use Routes

If you're not a fan of the note above, then you can consider using **Routes** instead.

Routes allow users to map a URL pattern to a Worker. When a request comes in to the Cloudflare network that matches the specified URL pattern, your Worker will execute on that route.

Routes can be a little bit trickier than Custom Domain. If you intend to use some routes without a subdomain like `abc.dev/api/something` then adding it by clicking on **Add route** in the dashboard is enough. But what if you want use something like `api.abc.dev/something`, then you will need to set up a DNS record with Cloudflare proxy (orange-clouded) for the website first. If the subdomain you intend to use here will not be used in anything else, simply point it to Cloudflare.

| Type | Name  | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `www` | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

Then you can use the **Add route** button the dashboard.

> Route pattern matching considers the entire request URL, including the query parameter string. Since route patterns may not contain query parameters, the only way to have a route pattern match URLs with query parameters is to terminate it with a wildcard, \*.

## Final notes

After setting all these configurations on the dashboard, all will be saved to `wrangler.toml` file in the Worker project, make sure you don't accidentally replace that configuration when deploying new code to the Worker.
