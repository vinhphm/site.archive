**Vinh.Dev ‘<span class="text-aquamarine-500">Aquamarine</span>’** is what I call the new version of the website. I won't lie, I kind of like Apple's practice of having a cool name for each release of macOS. So I want to do the same with my fresh start of Astro on Vinh.Dev.

> Aquamarine `/ˌäkwəməˈrēn/` is a beautiful blue-green color that evokes the purity of crystalline waters and the exhilaration and relaxation of the sea.
