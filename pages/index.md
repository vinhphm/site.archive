Hey, I am Vinh Pham, a software engineer.

Working at [PwC](https://pwc.com/).<br>
Core team member of Digital Solutions.<br>

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). I also do some UI/UX designing.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vinh.phm). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Ho Chi Minh City), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
