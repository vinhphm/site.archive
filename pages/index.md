Hey, I am Vinh Pham, a seasoned software engineer.

Working at [PwC](https://pwc.com/).<br>
A part of the Digital Solution team.<br>

My true passion lies in envisioning ideas and turning them into reality. Feel free to explore some of [my side projects here](/projects). Additionally, I have a knack for UI/UX design.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing amateur photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vinh.phm). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Ho Chi Minh City), maybe we can hang out and have some talks (or code).
