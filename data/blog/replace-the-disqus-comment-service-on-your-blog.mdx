When I first started my personal blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages in 2017, I can't help but notice that a lot of Jekyll themes use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). At that time, it was ~~arguably~~ the leading comment management system for both small and large websites. You could see its present everywhere, and here were some of the reasons why: ubiquitous integration, easy to set up, friendly admin panel, clean comment widget design, excellent spam filters, great content engaging features, etc. But soon later, Disqus had to ruin it by pushing ads. Currently, at the time of writing, Disqus is asking for an ~~inexpensive~~ $11 monthly fee per site to remove its imposed ads[^1]:

[^1]: Disqus: https://blog.disqus.com/our-plans-for-2017

> For an inexpensive monthly fee publishers will be able to completely remove ads and take advantage of all of Disqus‚Äô basic features and functionality.

This change affects a large number of indivisual bloggers and small businesses that rely on Disqus to handle their visitors‚Äô comments, including me. Fortunately, if your target audience is GitHub users, there are now great open-source alternatives out there to help you get rid of Disqus.

## Why replacing Disqus? üßê

- **Spammy ads:** Disqus ads are just intrusive. They cover a large portion of the screen and tend to be either click bait or fake news. And we have no control over them.
- **Performance issues:** Disqus is known to degrade page load time. This is mostly due to the syncing of comments back and forth with the server, and calling third party scripts when loading ads.
- **Privacy concerns:** Disqus introduces an additional layer of complexity to your website by forcing visitors to log in with their social media accounts when commenting. This obviously opens the door to privacy issues.

## The replacements

Okay, so now we're talking. What are the other options that we have?

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [giscus](https://giscus.app/)       | My preferred choice. It relies on GitHub new feature, Discussions, which means that it supports replies on comments and other cool features.                                                                   |
| [utterances](https://utteranc.es/)  | A lightweight comments widget built on top of GitHub Issues. It is one of the most widely used alternatives out there. However, given enough time, it might flood your repository‚Äôs Issues page with comments. |
| [Gitalk](https://gitalk.github.io/) | A modern component based on GitHub Issues and Preact. It supports cool features such as Facebook-like distraction free mode, hotkeys, and automatic language localization.                                     |

**Note:** These GitHub-based solutions are ideal for sites with an audience that skews towards developers who already have a GitHub account.

## Setting up Giscus

My blog is powered by Next.js but [giscus](https://giscus.app/) should play nice with any technology stack out there. It utilizes GitHub Discussions as a backing data store. One significant advantage of Giscus concerning other GitHub-based commenting systems is that repository Discussions are more suitable for comments. For example, it supports comments replies, more engaging discussion reactions, and is easier to moderate. In addition, it is lightweight, easy to configure, and secure. With Giscus, there is no need to worry about GitHub API rate limits, managing server-side code, manually linking blog posts to issues, or forcing users to leave your site to post a comment.

To set up Giscus, the GitHub repo has to meet only three requirement:

1. The repo is [public](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-public)
2. The [giscus](https://giscus.app/) app is installed on the repository
3. The Discussions feature is [enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)

To insert **giscus**, just add the following code where you want the comments to be displayed.

```html {3-6} showLineNumbers
<script
  src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
  data-repo="REPOSITORY_NAME"
  data-repo-id="REPOSITORY_ID"
  data-category="CATEGORY_NAME"
  data-category-id="CATEGORY_ID"
  data-mapping="pathname"
  data-reactions-enabled="1"
  data-emit-metadata="0"
  data-input-position="bottom"
  data-theme="light"
  data-lang="en"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async
></script>
```

Let's break down the variables:

- `REPOSITORY_NAME`: The name of the repository. Something like `giscus/giscus`.
- `CATEGORY_NAME`: The name of the category. Something like `Anouncements`.
- `REPOSITORY_ID` and `CATEGORY_ID`: Now these IDs you probably can't find in GitHub's UI. The app's homepage does not mention exactly how to get these either. To have these IDs, you have to [configure **giscus** for your repository](https://github.com/apps/giscus) first. Then you can come back to [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and type your repository name and choose the category in the dropdown. That's when you'll see the IDs at the end of the form.

## Conclusion

So that was how I quit Discus and used **giscus** instead. I'm glad I did. And I think you should too.
