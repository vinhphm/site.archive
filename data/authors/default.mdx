# About this site

Over the years, I have created a lot of blogs but never seems to have much time to invest on those or stick around for long. With **Vinh.Dev**, I want to change that, and to have a little something of mine on the internet. This site functions as a blog, where I share my thoughts, code, and my experiences. Opinions are my own. It also functions as a portfolio, where I showcase my work.

## Credits

I learn how to build this site from these most awesome people from the community:

- [@timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx) for incredible the [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).
- [@leerob](https://github.com/leerob) for the Spotify implementation.
